# Deep Learning Study
This repository was the records when studying deep learning courses, firstly I start DL courses from cs244n and cs231n.

## 1. cs244n
CS244N is meanly talk about how to do NLP tasks with DL,  cover word vector representations, window-based neural networks, recurrent neural networks, long-short-term-memory models,
recursive neural networks,convolutional neural networks as well as some recent models involving a memory component.Detail introduction at [here](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)
 
# 2. cs231n
This course is a deep dive into details of the deep learning architectures with a focus on learning end-to-end models for these tasks, particularly image classification.
detail introduction at [here](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)
 
## 3. Deep Learning Practice
 Here I also record the models and practice with tensorflow.
