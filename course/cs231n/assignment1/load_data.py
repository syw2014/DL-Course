"""Descriptions:
        A module to load data from CIFAR image dataset. From the interface provided load train sample and test sample.
        The variable names are just like symbols as in course.As we know CIFAR10 there were six training sample zip,
        and a test sample, detail descriptions about this dataset can be found https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
        , and we use <CIFAR-10 python version>. This part was reference <https://github.com/MyHumbleSelf/cs231n.git>"""
